Tape by Square, Inc.
====================

Tape is a collection of queue-related classes for Android and Java.

`QueueFile` is a lightning-fast, transactional, file-based FIFO. Addition and
removal from an instance is an O(1) operation and is atomic. Writes are
synchronous; data will be written to disk before an operation returns. The
underlying file is structured to survive process and even system crashes and if
an I/O exception is thrown during a mutating change, the change is aborted.

**NOTE:** The current implementation is built
for file systems that support atomic segment writes (like YAFFS). Most
conventional file systems don't support this; if the power goes out while
writing a segment, the segment will contain garbage and the file will be
corrupt. We'll add journaling support so `QueueFile` can be used with more
file systems later.

An `ObjectQueue` represents an ordering of arbitrary objects which can be backed
either by the filesystem (via `QueueFile`) or in memory only.

`TaskQueue` is a special object queue which holds `Task`s, objects which have a
notion of being executed. Instances are managed by an external executor which
prepares and executes enqueued tasks.
