/**
 * A reliable, efficient, file-based, FIFO queue. Additions and removals are
 * O(1). All operations are atomic. Writes are synchronous; data will be written
 * to disk before an operation returns. The underlying file is structured to
 * survive process and even system crashes. If an I/O exception is thrown during
 * a mutating change, the change is aborted. It is safe to continue to use a
 * {@code QueueFile} instance after an exception.
 * <p/>
 * <p>All operations are synchronized. In a traditional queue, the remove
 * operation returns an element. In this queue, {@link #peek} and {@link
 * #remove} are used in conjunction. Use {@code peek} to retrieve the first
 * element, and then {@code remove} to remove it after successful processing. If
 * the system crashes after {@code peek} and during processing, the element will
 * remain in the queue, to be processed when the system restarts.
 * <p/>
 * <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The current implementation is built
 * for file systems that support atomic segment writes (like YAFFS). Most
 * conventional file systems don't support this; if the power goes out while
 * writing a segment, the segment will contain garbage and the file will be
 * corrupt. We'll add journaling support so this class can be used with more
 * file systems later.
