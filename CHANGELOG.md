Change Log
==========

Version 2.0.0-RC1 *(In Development)*
--------------------------------

Tape 2 is a major release that focusses on simplifying the API. Tape 2 also adopts a new file format that allows QueueFile to grow beyond 4GB.

  * New: `remove(int)` allows atomic removal of multiple elements.
  * Improvement: `QueueFile` now implements the `Closeable` and `Iterable` interface.
  * Improvement: Simplified `ObjectQueue` API. `ObjectQueue` now implements the `Closeable` and `Iterable` interface. `ObjectQueue.Listener` has been removed.
  * New: Iterator API allows iterating queue items and stopping iteration early.
  * Improvement: New file format that allows QueueFile to grow beyond 4GB. Tape 2 can continue to operate on the v1 format. Existing queues are automatically migrated to the new format when they become empty. You can also force the legacy format by using the `forceLegacy` option.

Version 1.2.3 *(2014-10-07)*

Version 1.1.0 *(2012-11-08)*
